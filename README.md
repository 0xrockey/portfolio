# Mutawakil Portfolio Website

This is a personal portfolio website built with **React** and **Vite**. It showcases my skills, experience, projects, and provides contact options for potential clients or collaborators.

## Features

- **Responsive Design:** Works well on desktop and mobile devices.
- **Sections:** Home, About, Skills, Services, Qualification, Testimonials, Contact, Footer.
- **Contact Form:** Integrated with [EmailJS](https://www.emailjs.com/) for direct messaging.
- **Social Links:** Instagram, Twitter, GitHub, LinkedIn.
- **UI Libraries:** Uses [Boxicons](https://boxicons.com/) and [Unicons](https://iconscout.com/unicons) for icons.
- **Swiper:** For testimonials carousel.

## How It Works

- The site is a single-page React application.
- Navigation is handled via anchor links and smooth scrolling.
- Each section is a React component located in the `src/components/` directory.
- The contact form uses EmailJS to send emails directly from the site.
- Styles are written in CSS modules for each component.

## Development Tools

- **React**: UI library for building components.
- **Vite**: Fast build tool and development server.
- **EmailJS**: For sending emails from the contact form.
- **Swiper**: For testimonial slider.
- **Boxicons & Unicons**: Icon libraries.

## Getting Started

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```sh
   npm install# React + Vite
   ```

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
